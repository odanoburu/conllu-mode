* default key bindings

| key binding | description                                                                                          |
|-------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| =C-c C-a=   | align columns (inserts no real whitespace) in the selected region (defaults to the current sentence) |
| =C-c C-u=   | unalign columns in the selected region (defaults to current sentence)                                |
| =C-c C-f=   | hide fields specified (an ellipsis will be shown)                                                    |
| =C-c C-s=   | show fields specified (all of them, if none provided)                                                |
| =M-n=       | unalign current sentence, go to the next one, and align it                                           |
| =M-p=       | unalign current sentence, go to the previous one, and align it                                       |
| =C-c f=     | move forward to next field in a token line                                                           |
| =C-c b=     | move backward to previous field in a token line                                                      |
| =C-c C-h=   | move point to head token of present token                                                            |

* features

- highlighting comments, and =upostag= and =deprel= fields
- truncate lines by default
- show newline and tab characters using =whitespace.el=
- aligning and unaligning column fields
- jumping to next or previous sentence
- in a token line, jump to its =head=

* missing
  if you'd like to have a feature implemented, you should file at
  ticket at the [[https://github.com/odanoburu/conllu-mode/issues][issue tracker]]. here is our wishlist of what we would
  like to implement in the future:

- hiding columns
- call a parser to create CoNLL-U output from a sentence
- call external visualization tool
- validating CoNLL-U file
# - in a sentence, jump to token that has a given index
# - in sentence, jump to next token that has a given =upostag=
# - in sentence, jump to next token that has a given =deprel=
# are the above three really interesting? emacs can do better with
# incremental search and other functionality
- ...
  
* installation
  first you must install the dependencies: assuming you have a
  standard Emacs distribution, the only package needed which is
  probably not installed yet is [[https://github.com/cute-jumper/parsec.el][parsec]]. (this won't have to be done
  manually after issue #4 is resolved.) 

  after having installed =parsec=, clone the repo and put these files
  where emacs will load them, as in:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ cd ~/some/path/
  $ git clone https://github.com/odanoburu/conllu-mode
#+END_SRC
  in your =.emacs=:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/some/path/conllu-mode")
(require 'conllu-mode)
#+END_SRC

* contributing
  contributions are welcome! even comments from experienced elispers
  are welcome. just send an email or open an issue -- if you'd like a
  suggestion on what to work on, take a look at the open issues or at
  the missing features (above).
